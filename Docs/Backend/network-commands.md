## To check if a service is running on port 3000:

To check if something is running on localhost:3000 on a Linux system, you can use the lsof (List Open Files) command to see if any process is listening on that port. This command is useful for identifying what process is using a particular port. You might need to install lsof if it's not already available on your system. You can also use netstat, part of the net-tools package, or the more modern ss command, which is included with the iproute2 package.

### Using `lsof`:

```text
sudo lsof -i :3000
```

This command lists all processes that are listening on `port 3000`. You'll see output including the command name, PID, user, and more, if a process is indeed listening on that port.

### Using `ss`:

```text
sudo ss -ltnp | grep ':3000'
```

The `ss` command is used to dump **socket statistics**. This command **filters the output** for entries listening (`-l`) on TCP ports (`-t`) with numeric port numbers (`-n`), showing the process (`-p`) using the port, and then uses `grep` to filter for `port 3000`.

### Using `netstat`:

```text
sudo netstat -ltnp | grep ':3000'
```

Similar to `ss`, `netstat` shows **network statistics**. The **flags** used here are `-l` to show **listening ports**, `-t` for **TCP ports**, `-n` to display **addresses** and **port numbers** in **numerical form**, and `-p` to show the **PID** and **name of the program** to which **each socket** belongs. Then, `grep` filters for `port 3000`.

## Note:

* You might need sudo to see the process ID and process name owned by other users.
* If you get output from these commands, it means something is running on port 3000. The output will also typically include the PID (Process ID) and the name of the process, which can help you identify what specifically is running on that port.
* If there's no output, then nothing is currently listening on port 3000.
